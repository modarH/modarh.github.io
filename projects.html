    <h4 class="card-title">Comfy Real estate App</h4>
    <p class="card-text">
     This project consists of a mobile application that allows users to buy and sell property online. This app would also feature other options associated with real estate buying and selling such as renovation, staging, permits, and legal services although the buying and selling can be carried out without a real estate agent. We would like to make this app a veritable “one stop shop” for all activities associated with buying and selling property. Local vendors can also advertise their businesses to potential customers looking for their services (carpenters, lawyers, etc), and past customers can give reviews on these vendors. Users can also auction their property online and view best offers. This application will also include a forum that customers and contractors can use to discuss reviews on certain contractors or potential offers.

      A fully functional Airline Management System written in C# using the
      proper object oriented principles, this project was a requirment for our
      class. This system is capable of managing customers, managing flights and
      manging bookings just like a real world scenario on airports. It is a
      standalone program which can only be run on windows.

    <h4 class="card-title">ToDo List</h4>
    <p class="card-text">
      The conventional way to keep track of daily routines is writing them down
      in a notebook or planner. However, it is tedious to always have to carry
      additional items, while nearly everyone has their smartphone on them all
      the time, sometimes there’s a need to share the daily tasks. This
      application is intended for use by anyone who prefers to keep a to-do
      list.
